\aboutme{%
I am a true full-stack developer with about 20 years in software and web development. I'm
comfortable in both front-end and back-end teams, whether it be working on a responsive React.js app, 
designing a distributed software system, writing complex database queries or even debugging
an Ubuntu server. A pragmatist at heart, I try to approach every project with a fresh perspective by
carefully considering core requirements and constraints. I've worked with a diverse set of
languages and frameworks, but believe it is important to use the right tool for the job.
An opportunity to learn something new is always a plus!
